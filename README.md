Bug Hop
=======

Bug Hop is an HTML-based Frogger game.

##Installation
Open the index.html page, and the game will start automatically.

##How to play
Your character starts on the grass at the bottom of the screen.  It is your goal to use the arrow keys to make it across the stone path to the water.  On the stone path, you have to avoid the bugs that are crawling across it.  If you collide with a bug, you’ll be sent back to the start.

##To do
* Create a character-selection menu.
* Create coins and other treasure to collect while crossing.
* Create “you win” and “game over” end scenes.
